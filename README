This project should help you identify potentially incorrect data in ntriples format.

* First of all you will need to download the data you wish to clean.

* If your data is broad / about multiple things try and focus on a particular subset of the data

For example this SPARQL query will identify all the resources that have been called a country in dbpedia;

select distinct ?x where { 
 ?something <http://dbpedia.org/property/country> ?x .
}

The results of this query can be found in the examples folder in countrylist;

* Create a subset of the dbpedia dataset which just contains the resources in country list

for country in $(cat countrylist)
do
 grep "^<$country>" dbpedia.nt >> countrydata
done

* Finally;

cat countrydata | perl guesserator.pl > countrypredicates.out

* This will produce a file with a count of predicates for every country

* This data can now be interpreted in two (probably more :)) ways;

1. Low counts on predicates might indicate that a country has an incorrect predicate and should be investigated

2. Low counts might indicate that the resource is not actually a country - and should be investigated;

* To identify this;

TODO



* To produce a simple visulisation of this;

cat countrypredicates.out | perl mkvis.pl > pie.html
